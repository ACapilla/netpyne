* 15may27 Modularized framework for NEURON/Python network simulations with MPI
** Overview
Using this modularized structure can select different cell types, populations, connectivities, etc. just by modifying the
parameters in params.py. 

An example is provided in params.py which switches from a single Hodgkin-Huxley population, randomly connected model
(mpiHHTut); to a multiple Izhikevich populations, yfrac-dependent connected M1 model.

** README with description of the different files
List of files:

- main.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules.

- params.py: Contains all static parameters. It is imported as "p" from all other modules, so that params can be referenced from any file using p.paramName

- shared.py: Contains all the model shared variables and modules (except params.py). It is imported as "s" from all other file, so that any variable or module can be referenced from any file using s.varName

- sim.py: Simulation control functions (eg. runSim)

- network.py: Network related functions (eg. createCells)

- cell.py: contains cell and population classes 

- conn.py: contains class 'Conn' used to instantiate connections, and contains methods to connect cells (eg. random, yfrac-based)

- analysis.py: functions to plot and analyse data

- stimuli.py: functions and parameters for differnt types of neural stimulation

- izhi2007.mod: NMODL definition of Izhikevich 2007 neuron model

- evol.py: Functions to run evolutionary algorithms (using inspyred) to optimize model parameters

** Known issues, potential improvements, and alternative implementations
*** Saving only happens at the end (instead of at fixed intervals)
*** Need to add a DEBUG mode or similar (like mpiHHTut had)
- currently have a verbose flag, that prints some additional info
*** Have print messages along the code, which could be made optional
*** Structure of data saved to file
- some nested lists with inhomogeneous dimensionality were converted to 'object' data types in order to be saved -- check if
  structure makes sense when reading from python/matlab
*** Some attributes/variables of the class 'Cell' and 'Pop' are not used but still initialized to [ ]
- maybe can find alternative using different constructors for different cell types
*** Labels (eg. AMPA, IT, HH,...) are defined by assigning numeric values to variables
- can use dictionaries instead
- need to check pros and cons of each -- are dicts slower or have any limitations compared to lists/arrays ?
*** stimuli.py not tested with this model
- left there cause thought could be useful for future
*** Some variables inherited from cliff still have too long names, eg. backgroundSpikevec
*** BasicPop and YfracPop
*** if increase p.backgroundNoise > 0.0 get memory error 
*** Find a way to save lambda funcs (can't be pickled)
