# M1NetworkModel
## Description
This example is based on the multiscale model of mouse primary motor cortex (M1) example.
In the init.py function it shows code on how to use the interval saving function and save the synWeights periodically.
The key differences are the use of intervalRun and effectively defining two intervals, one for saving weights and one
saving the data. Note also, the use of fileGather instead of gather.

## Setup and execution

Requires NEURON with Python and MPI support. 

1. Type or `./compile or the equivalent `nrnivmodl mod`. This should create a directory called either i686 or x86_64, depending on your computer's architecture. 
2. To run type: `./runsim [num_proc]' or the equivalent `mpiexec -np [num_proc] nrniv -python -mpi init.py`

## Overview of file structure:

* /init.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules. Sets what parameter file to use.

* /netParams.py: Network parameters

* /cfg.py: Simulation configuration
