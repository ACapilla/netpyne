How to connect m1ms with Plexon and run?
# Connect m1ms with Plexon
- Copy m1ms/sim/Client to Windows machine having MATLAB and Plexon software.
- Open Client/plx_mat_interface.m on the Windows machine, and set up "remoteAddr" to the IP address m1ms runs on. In addition, set up "addapth" with the path for the library required for the Plexon software.
- Set up parameters in m1ms/sim/config.py accordingly.
  isOriginal|isCommunication|isQueueTest
  a. 1 | x | x - To run the original m1ms (Cliff's parallelized model). X means don't care
  b. 0 | 1 | 1 - To run m1ms w/o connection to Plexon, but with PMd spike files
  c. 0 | 1 | 0 - To run m1ms, getting spikes from Plexon through the communication program
  Note: for b and c, check if PMd spike file (spikePMd-6sec.txv) is in data/.
# Run m1ms
For a, b:
$plx_runsim <# of workers>

For c,
1. Run client in the Windows machine.
2. $plx_runsim <# of workers>
3. Run the Plexon softsever.

How to plot spikes?
Spikes are stored in m1ms/sim/m1ms-spk.txt.
$python quickplot.py or $python quickplot.py <filename> <scale> <duration for plot> <weight>
<filename>: default is m1ms-spk.txt
<scale>   : default is 10
<duration>: default is 6 (sec)
<weight>  : default is 0
