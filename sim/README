List of files:

- main.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules.

- params.py: Contains all static parameters. It is imported as "p" from all other modules, so that params can be referenced from any file using p.paramName

- shared.py: Contains all the model shared variables and modules (except params.py). It is imported as "s" from all other file, so that any variable or module can be referenced from any file using s.varName

- sim.py: Simulation control functions (eg. runSim)

- network.py: Network related functions (eg. createCells)

- cell.py: contains cell and population classes 

- conn.py: contains connectivity class

- analysis.py: functions to plot and analyse data

- stimuli.py: functions and parameters for differnt types of neural stimulation

- izhi2007.mod: NMODL definition of Izhikevich 2007 neuron model

- evol.py: Functions to run evolutionary algorithms (using inspyred) to optimize model parameters
