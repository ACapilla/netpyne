"m1" is a NEURON/Python-based model of primary motor cortex (M1)

Using this modularized structure, user can select different cell types, populations, connectivities, etc. just by modifying the parameters in params.py. 

An example is provided in params.py, which switches from a single Hodgkin-Huxley population, randomly connected model
(mpiHHTut); to a multiple Izhikevich populations, yfrac-dependent connected M1 model.

To test this just modify the variable simType in params.py: 
simType = 'M1model' # 'mpiHHTut'

List of files:

- main.py: Main executable; calls functions from other modules.

- params.py: Contains all static parameters. It is imported as "p" from all other modules, so that params can be referenced from any file using p.paramName

- shared.py: Contains all the model shared variables and modules (except params.py). It is imported as "s" from all other file, so that any variable or module can be referenced from any file using s.varName

- sim.py: Simulation control functions (eg. runSim)

- network.py: Network related functions (eg. createCells)

- cell.py: contains cell and population classes 

- conn.py: contains class 'Conn' used to instantiate connections, and contains methods to connect cells (eg. random, yfrac-based)

- analysis.py: functions to visualize and analyse data
