NetPyNE Overview
=======================================

What is NetPyNE?
----------------

NetPyNE (**Net**\ works using **Py**\ thon and **NE**\ URON) is a python package to facilitate the development, parallel simulation and analysis of biological neuronal networks using the NEURON simulator.
Although NEURON already enables multiscale simulation ranging from the molecular to the network level, NEURON for networks, often requiring parallel simulations, requires substantial programming. NetPyNE greatly facilitates the development and parallel simulation of biological neuronal networks in NEURON for students and experimentalists. NetPyNE is also intended for experienced modelers, providing powerful features to incorporate complex anatomical and physiological data into models.

Project roadmap
---------------------

- Robustness, reliability and reproducibility of existing features

- Ongoing development of new features

- Dissemination and community engagement



From grant:
SA1: Quality control: reliability, robustness and reproducibility:
SA1.1 Ensuring reliability of new features, such that they perform their intended function under all valid conditions and inputs. These features include: molecular reaction-diffusion (RxD) components, generation of complex complex subcellular connectivity patterns, distributed saving, and parameter optimization via evolutionary algorithms. 
SA1.2 Ensuring tool robustness and error handling, such that it is able to cope with erroneous inputs and errors during execution. Improved tool robustness will include input validation, exception handling and informational messages, which will prevent user frustration and largely increase the tool's accessibility. 
SA1.3 Ensuring simulation reproducibility across the most common platforms, including different versions of operating systems, Python, NEURON, MPI library; and HPC platform setup (eg XSEDE/NSG, Google Cloud Platform).

SA2: Extension of the graphical user interface (GUI). The NetPyNE GUI will be essential to engage new users and disseminate the tool to experimentalists, clinicians and students. We will extend it as follows: 
SA2.1 Incorporating missing components, that are currently only accessible programmatically: RxD, subcellular connectivity, complex stimulation and parameter optimization (only grid search).
SA2.2 Enabling a web-based multi-user deployment that allows users to build models and run simulations through a web browser over the internet, making the tool publicly available to the global research community.   
SA2.3 Improving plots by replacing the current static images with modern interactive and dynamic plots that facilitate understanding complex and large datasets, for the most common plots (connectivity matrix, raster plot and voltage traces).
SA2.4 Improving performance to enable 3D visualization and manipulation of medium-scale networks of ~1k-10k detailed neurons (currently limited to a few hundred).  

SA3. User training. We will implement complementary dissemination strategies to attract users and ensure these can effectively and reliably use NetPyNE beyond the duration of the project:
SA3.1 Updated and comprehensive online documentation covering all the tool components, options and modes of usage, with examples, so both beginner and advanced users can independently explore and fully exploit the tool.  
SA3.2 Online interactive tutorials so new users can receive training at their own pace through multimedia-rich step-by-step instructions that can be executed interactively (eg via GUI or Jupyter Notebook).
SA3.3 Workshops/tutorials at neuroscience conferences to engage potential users by providing an overview of the tool functionalities and benefits. 
SA3.4 Annual 1-day in-person course to provide in-depth training to researchers who could then teach tool usage at their labs or institutions.
