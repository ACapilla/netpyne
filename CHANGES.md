## Version 0.3.1

- Fixed bug: h.dt now set to value of simConfig['dt']

## Version 0.3

First version that was uploaded to pypi. Includes following features:

- Clear separation (modularization) of parameter specifications, network instantiation and NEURON simulation code.

- Easy-to-use, standardized, flexible, extensible and NEURON-independent format to specify parameters:
	- Populations
	- Cell property rules
	- Connectivity rules
	- Simulation configuration

- Support for cell location (eg. cortical depth) dependence of cell density and connectivity.

- Easy specification, importing and swapping of cell models (eg. point neuron vs multicompartment)

- Support for hybrid networks eg. combining point and multicompartment neurons.

- Multiple connectivity functions (eg. full, convergent, probabilistic) with optional parameters (eg. delay range)

- Support for user-defined connectivity functions.

- Populations, cell properties and connectivity rules can include reference to annotations (eg. for provenance).

- NEURON-independent instantiation of network (all cells, connections, ...) using Python objects and containers.

- NEURON-specific instantiation of network ready for simulation.

- Enables sharing of Python-based network objects, which can then be instantiated and simulated in NEURON.

- Easy MPI parallel simulation of network, including cell distribution across nodes an gathering of data from all nodes.

- Analysis and visualization of network (eg. connecitivity matrix) and simulation output (eg. voltage traces, raster plot)

- Data exporting/sharing to several formats (pickle, Matlab, JSON, HDF5) of the following:
	- Parameters/specifications
	- Instantiated networks
	- Simulation results
